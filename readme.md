# Container As A Servce (CAAS) 
YOUR NEW PLATFORM FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS


Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a form of container-based virtualization in which container engines, orchestration and the underlying compute resources are delivered to users as a service from a cloud provider.

CaaS offerings provide users with the agility required for architecting solutions using containers and enable DevOps teams to automate the “CHECKIN to GO-LIVE” process for any containerized application, which significantly reduces the “TIME to DEPLOY,” as well as the “TIME to GO-LIVE” into production. Containers have created a great advantage for infrastructure and DevOps teams, enabling them to focus on keeping the digital IT platform “alive” and equipped with underlying hardware resources for hosted applications and platforms to scale.

Enterprise DevOps teams have multiple options here to manage and host the containerized software, including:

- Building their own CaaS using tools like Deis, Flynn, Tsuru, Dawn and Octohost
- Using “out-of-the-box” solutions like Red Hat OpenShift and Cloud Foundry

CaaS can enable technology teams to achieve a competitive advantage via their digital IT infrastructures by doing more with less and enabling applications to scale very quickly. Cluster management is another advantage of CaaS solutions, with some having built in the intelligence for zero downtime upgrades using clusters of containers.
